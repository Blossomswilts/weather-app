# weather-view

## This app will present to you data about the current weather and 5 day forecast of the city that you enter.
### The variables included are;
    * An icon of the current weather condition
    * The city name of the entered city
    * The temperature in Fahrenheit 
    * The humidity %
    * The wind speed in MPH 

## Every search is displayed in a search history, in which you can reclick to enter the city back to the sear ch bar, and enter for results once again.

## The search history is stored in local data, so that it can be accessed if the browser is closed and opened at another time.

### Hint: You can clear local storage through the inspect/appplication/localstorage element on the browser.

## Some of the problems solved that are of interest.

* Pulling from an API to target the information you want, and append it to the HTML elements.
* Saving results in a local storage for future use.
